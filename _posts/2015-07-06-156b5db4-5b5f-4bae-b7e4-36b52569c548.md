# About Micah

Micah Moss is a writer / director / illustrator and an honored alumnus of George Fox University.  His work has been featured by institutions such as MovieMaker Magazine and Art Basel Miami.  He lives with his lovely wife in loony Los Angeles.

Before he hit the big "double-digits," Micah was already writing and illustrating his own comic books.  Nothing could stop this pint-sized crime-fighter dashing home after school and diving into vibrant worlds.  Bold, colorful stories are what he craved, and he gobbled them up by the baker's dozen.  On any given day, his babysitters were: Batman, Indiana Jones, Sherlock Holmes, Superman, Star Wars, Ducktales, Back to the Future ...

To this day --- if you give Micah cinematic stories -- he's livin' the life of Riley.  He's spent years honing his craft so he can share his stories with you; he hopes you dig (or maybe even cherish) them.  He knows the thrill of a well-spun-yarn --- and as he clatters away on his keyboard while you journey through his work -- he's geekin' out right alongside you.

Micah is a partner of One Day's Wages; 5% of the author's proceeds are donated to help sustain ODW's Operations Budget.
